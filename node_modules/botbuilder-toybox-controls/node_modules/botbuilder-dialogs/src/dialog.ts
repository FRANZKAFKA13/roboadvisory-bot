/**

 * 
 * @remarks
 * Waterfalls accept a stack of functions which will be executed in sequence. Each waterfall step 
 * can ask a question of the user and the users response will be passed as an argument to the next 
 * waterfall step.
 * 
 * For simple text questions you can send the user a message and then process their answer in the 
 * next step:
 * 
 * ```JavaScript
 *  dialogs.add('namePrompt', [
 *      async function (dc) {
 *          dc.activeDialog.state.profile = { first: '', last: '', full: '' };

 *          profile.last = lastName;
 *          profile.full = profile.first + ' ' + profile.last;
 *          await dc.end(profile);
 *      }
 *  ]);
 * ```
 * 
 * For more complex sequences you can call other dialogs from within a step and the result returned 
 * by the dialog will be passed to the next step:
 * 
 * ```JavaScript
 *  dialogs.add('survey', [
 *      async function (dc) {
 *          dc.activeDialog.state.survey = { name: undefined, languages: '', years: 0 };
 *          await dc.begin('namePrompt');
 *      },
 *      async function (dc, name) {
 *          dc.activeDialog.state.survey.name = name;
 *          await dc.context.sendActivity(`Ok ${name.full}... What programming languages do you know?`);
 *      },
 *      async function (dc, languages) {
 *          dc.activeDialog.state.survey.languages = languages;
 *          await dc.prompt('yearsPrompt', `Great. So how many years have you been programming?`);
 *      },
 *      async function (dc, years) {
 *          dc.activeDialog.state.survey.years = years;
 *          await dc.context.sendActivity(`Thank you for taking our survey.`);
 *          await dc.end(dc.activeDialog.survey);
 *      }
 *  ]);
 * 
 *  dialogs.add('yearsPrompt', new NumberPrompt(async (dc, value) => {
 *      if (value === undefined || value < 0 || value > 110) {
 *          await dc.context.sendActivity(`Enter a number from 0 to 110.`); 
 *      } else {
 *          return value;
 *      }
 *  }));
 * ```
 * 
 * The example builds on the previous `namePrompt` sample and shows how you can call another dialog
 * which will ask its own sequence of questions. The dialogs library provides a built-in set of 
 * prompt classes which can be used to recognize things like dates and numbers in the users response.
 * 
 * You should generally call `dc.end()` or `dc.replace()` from your last waterfall step but if you fail 
 * to do that the dialog will be automatically ended for you on the users next reply.  The users 
 * response will be passed to the calling dialogs next waterfall step if there is one.
